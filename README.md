## Features

### Run setup

- Pick how many **Sinners** to bring (1–12).
- Choose how many **EGOs per Sinner** (1–5).
- Option to **randomise deployment order**:
  - Positions 1–7 are treated as **on-field**.
  - Positions 8–12 are **support**.
- For each chosen Sinner:
  - Exactly **one Identity** is selected.
  - Up to 5 **EGOs** are chosen, **max one per rank** (ZAYIN / TETH / HE / WAW / ALEPH) (yes, ALEPH isn't a thing yet but it's nice to have it ready for whenever they add it...much later on...much, much later on...probably years from now).

### Owned IDs/EGOs

Select the IDs/EGOs you actually own so the randomiser only pulls from them and not any you don't actually own (yet).

---

### Saved teams

- Save the **current randomised team** with a custom name.
- View a saved team at any point (will overwrite the currently randomised team though, so be careful).
